THESE ARE THE STEPS WE FOLLOW TO CREATE THE APP

STEP-1 : create separate repos/folder for front end and backend like loanUI and loan api

STEP-2 : install angular cli in the frond end part to initialise the angular app command

STEP-3 : create the angular app by the command ng new loansUI

STEP-4 : verify the app is running or not by running the command ng serve

STEP-5 : install bootstrap frame work and jquery in angular and add them in the angular.json in both script and
script section 

STEP-6 : Install the express generetor refer to the express doc

STEP-7 : verify the api is working or not

//Then it's time for to set-up the DATABASE (we are using mongodb here)

STEP-8 : create a new database using mongodb compass and name it LoanManager inside the Loan-api

STEP-9 : install the mongoose librery inside the Loan-api to connect the DATABASE with node.js

STEP-10 : create a models folder and create different schema of ur collections , export the models

STEP-11 : Then import all the models in the there respective router.js [const loginModels = require('../Models/UsersLogin.model')]

STEP-12 : import all the routes to the app.js file [var loginRouter = require('./routes/login');]
 
//Then we came to the front end 

STEP-13 : Then we create the two module signIn and logIn modules by this command [ng g module logIn --route logIn --module app.module].it 
will create module and automatically lazy-loaded

STEP-14 : create some components with out lazyloading to load the components at the begining

STEP-15 :Then add routing in the html element by the help of angular route [<a class="nav-link" routerLinkActive="active" [routerLink]="'logIn'">LogIn</a>]
or with the help of href="logIn"

//again back to backend

STEP-16: we install the mongoose librery in the background and connecting to our database(LoansManager)
